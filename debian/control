Description: Golang POSIX 1e ACL bindings
 go-acl Golang POSIX.1e ACL bindings.  Essentially bindings to
 /usr/include/sys/acl.h notesmac os x Mac OS X does not seem to support
 basic POSIX1.e ACLs. They do provide the POSIX API for NFSv4 ACLs. It
 would be nice for this package to also support NFSv4 ACLs.  freebsd By
 default, FreeBSD does not enable POSIX1.e ACLs on the root partition. To
 enable them, reboot into single-user mode and execute: $ tunefs -a enable
 $ reboot
 .
 Source: https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/fs-acl.html info The
 IEEE POSIX.1e specification describes five security extensions to the
 base POSIX.1 API: Access Control Lists (ACLs), Auditing, Capabilities,
 Mandatory Access Control, and Information Flow Labels.  The specificaiton
 was abandoned before finalization, however most UNIX-like operating
 systems have some form of ACL implementation.
